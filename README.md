Mobs deal normal damage to player regardless of difficulty.

Purpose
-

First take a look at a quote from Minecraft wiki: [link](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Damage/Mobs)

> The damage mobs deal to players is affected by the difficulty of the game. The below values represent the amount of damage taken per hit.
> - This applies only to mobs attacking **the player**. Mobs attacking other mobs always deal the 'Normal' damage listed, regardless of difficulty.

So if I set my difficulty to hard, when attacking me, all mobs just gain some sort of mysterious power out of nowhere, and do 1.5x damage to me, while they just do 1x normal damage when attacking each other.

This feels weird to me, breaking the immersion of the game. So I fixed it.

Why not play on normal difficulty?
-

Because the difference between normal and hard isn't all about damage.

In hard difficulty, player can starve to death, zombie can break doors, villagers 100% turn into zombie villagers, and the regional difficulty is higher, which contributes to more aspects. You can check the minecraft wiki for more information: [link](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Difficulty)

So hard is like the full version of the game, while normal and easy cut out some features.
